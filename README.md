# 🚀 End-to-End SQL + Power BI Project | Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard

I recently completed an end-to-end Data Analytics project where I analyzed pizza sales data using MSSQL and Power BI to uncover key business insights.

## 🔎 Project Objective
To analyze sales performance, customer ordering patterns, and product performance to support better business decisions.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Microsoft SQL Server** - Data extraction & KPI validation
- **Power BI** - Data modeling & dashboarding
- **Power Query** - Data cleaning & transformation
- **Excel** - Initial data handling

## 📊 Key KPIs Developed
- ✔ **Total Revenue:** $817,860
- ✔ **Total Orders:** 21,350
- ✔ **Total Pizzas Sold:** 49,574
- ✔ **Average Order Value:** $38.31
- ✔ **Avg Pizzas per Order:** 2.32

All KPIs were first calculated using SQL queries and then validated inside Power BI to ensure data accuracy.

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

### 📌 Sales Trends
- Orders are highest on weekends (Friday & Saturday evenings)
- Peak months: January & July
- Clear daily and monthly ordering patterns identified

### 📌 Category & Size Insights
- Classic category contributes the highest revenue
- Large size pizzas generate the highest share of sales

### 📌 Performance Analysis (Page 2)
- Top 5 & Bottom 5 pizzas identified by:
  - Revenue
  - Quantity Sold
  - Total Orders
- This helps identify strong performers and underperforming products for potential optimization.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Writing optimized SQL queries (CTEs, aggregations, subqueries)
- KPI validation using SQL before visualization
- Data modeling and DAX measure creation in Power BI
- Designing clean, interactive, multi-page dashboards

This project strengthened my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using SQL and Power BI.
